## Thoughts

- Maybe we can have an out-of-line job that looks at images and creates a map between images and their sizes. With that we could build a middleware or plugin somewhere in the process, that sets up propper next/images with width and height in place.

## Todo

- Maybe turn theme into a context? Would be great to always knwo whats up and coudl listen to changes in prefers-color-scheme, could also sync across open tabs. But might be an optimization we don't need. Right now for header images but that will be solved with using SVGs.
- li items in markdown are not rendered as lists.
