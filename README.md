## Thoughts

- Maybe we can have an out-of-line job that looks at images and creates a map between images and their sizes. With that we could build a middleware or plugin somewhere in the process, that sets up propper next/images with width and height in place.

## Todo

- Improve image handling

- Custom 404 page

- Maybe filter options for /posts. Posibility to filter for certain tags, categories, search terms or date ranges would be amazing.
- Maybe shortcut to cmd+K search posts from /posts.
- Maybe turn theme into a context? Would be great to always knwo whats up and coudl listen to changes in prefers-color-scheme, could also sync across open tabs. But might be an optimization we don't need. Right now for header images but that will be solved with using SVGs. This would also enable the site to react to system color scheme changes.
