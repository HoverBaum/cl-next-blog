![Festive Greetings - ChatGPT and Midjourney](/images/general/2023-happy-holidays-banner.png)

Happy Holidays and festive greetings, powered by ChatGPT, Midjourney and a little bit of Photoshop.

Utilizing my [Custom GPT for Midjourney prompts](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-jvU1LDhpM-hoverbaums-image-wizard) ([open source on GitHub](https://github.com/HoverBaum/image-wizard-gpt)), I generated the image and some subtle variations in three rounds. Finally touching it up with a tagline in Photopea.

**Initial prompt:**

>A whimsical watercolor Illustration of a teddy bear wearing a Christmas hat, handing over a present

**Custom GPT generated prompt:**

>A playful watercolor illustration, featuring a small, round teddy bear in a plush, red Christmas hat, giving a gift box wrapped in shiny, colorful paper. The style should be whimsical and charming, akin to Beatrix Potter's illustrations, focusing on delicate details and soft, dreamy textures. Lighting should be gentle and diffused, giving a morning-like Christmas glow. The color palette includes warm, muted tones, with splashes of bright red and green for the hat and gift, respectively. The composition is close-up, focusing on the teddy bear's expression and the detail of the present in its paws.

Final adjustmets and the addition of text were done using [Photopea.com](https://www.photopea.com/).
