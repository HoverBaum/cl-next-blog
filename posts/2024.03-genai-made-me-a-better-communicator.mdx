Prompt Engineering has become a passion topic of mine. It's super fun to tinker with GenAI, to ask it questions and to optimize the way that I ask those questions.

The basic of Prompt Engineering are simple:

- **Task** specify a task that you want the LLM to do for you.
- **Context** give the chatbot the context that it needs to complete your task.
- **Format** how do you want the LLM to respond to you? A bullet point list? A table? A slide deck? a blogpost?
- **Process** if you already know a great process to solve the problem, tell the AI to follow it. If you don't, at least give it room to think.

Recently I noticed that following these practices for using AI has honed my communication skills even when talking to colleagues. The same principles apply. My coworker also needs to know any context that I do but they don't. They need to know who am I to talk to them, how do I see them, why do I think they can help and what do i need help with. And finally, how would I like them to support me.

I never would have expected that learning to talk with AI would make me a better communicator with humans. But it does, and I love it.
